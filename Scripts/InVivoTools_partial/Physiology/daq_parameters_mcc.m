%   Can be used either with 'input_arg' as an input argument or without.

%
%   MCC DAQ PCI DAS-6025 has a fixed 12 bits per sample and 8 analog
%   differential inputs.

%%% Data Aqcuisition Timing %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% number of blocks/timeslots of each measuring session. The latter is
% multiplied by 10 sec and an additional 10 seconds are added to the total
% acquisition time per session.
%
% Timing between sessions is less critical in terms of speed. This will not
% exceed the time it takes to load the parameters and Analog Input Object
% and should be at least more than a minute.

%%% Retrieve trigger information and save directory reference from Stimulus-PC %%%

% changed. If there is more than one channel, each channel has to be
% configured (and added if not present) separately.

% Input Range can be set at either -5 and 5 -> enter 5, or -10 and 10
