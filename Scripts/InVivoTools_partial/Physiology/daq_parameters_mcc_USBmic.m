function [ ai_vec, settings ] = daq_parameters_mcc_USBmic( input_arg )
%daq_parameters_mcc(input_arg) gives acquisition pre-set parameters to main 
%script.
%   
%   Can be used either with 'input_arg' as an input argument or without.
%
%   In this function all relevant parameters can be set for the physiology
%   data acquisition main script. The function is specifically written for
%   the DAQ PCI DAS-6025 acquisition card and the Dodotronic USB mic.
%
%   MCC DAQ PCI DAS-6025 has a fixed 12 bits per sample and 8 analog 
%   differential inputs.
%
%   Returns the vector ai_vec which contains multiple Analog Input objects.
%       - EMG & Heart rate recording via MCC DAQ
%       - Ultrasound recordings via Dodotronic USB mic.

%   Revision:
%       -> add check code to check if mic is connected to usb

%%% Data Aqcuisition Timing %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Timing is obtained by reading a timer file, or by extracting the total
% number of blocks/timeslots of each measuring session. The latter is
% multiplied by 10 sec and an additional 10 seconds are added to the total
% acquisition time per session. 
%    
% Timing between sessions is less critical in terms of speed. This will not
% exceed the time it takes to load the parameters and Analog Input Object
% and should be at least more than a minute.
