%      Computes the suppression index as by Carandini: To quantify the
%      strength of this surround suppression, we defined a suppression
%      index as (Rp â€“ RL)/RP, where RL and RP are the responses
%      to the largest size and to the preferred size. For robustness,
%      we defined the latter as the smallest size that elicited >95% of
%      the maximal response (Figure 1B). (Carandini writes (Rp-RL)/RL but
%      that's probably a type. See Cavanaugh, Bair, Movhson, JNeurophys 2002
