% revision 893, 2012-06-27 is a good version for reintegration

Fixes
========
A: ISUNIX_SV is no longer correct (since matlab VERSION command changed).    
A possible fix is:

   if strncmp(computer,'PC',2)
       b = 0; 
   elseif strcmp(computer,'MAC2')
      b = 0; 
   else 
      b = 1;
   end

but this will only work as long as there are no new non-unix operating systems. 
Or we can do some parsing on VERSION, but that might be even more fragile.

A: SERIAL. On MAC OS9 computers the function SERIAL was provided by PTB2. On newer versions
of Matlab, there is a function SERIAL to control the serial port, with a different interface.
To avoid confusion PTB has renamed their SERIAL function to PSYCHSERIAL. PSYCHSERIAL however does 
not seem to be maintained. To make the STIMSERIAL interface work, I changed STIMSERIAL from
an empty function into a wrapper around PSYCHSERIAL on MAC2 systems and a wrapper around Matlab's 
SERIAL on other systems. All calls to SERIAL in the NewStim code I had to replace by calls 
to STIMSERIAL. The arguments should work without change.

General questions
=================
A: Do you think it makes a difference where to have the communication directory 
   at the stimulus slave or the runexperiment host?

A: INITSTIMS: Early in initstims, quickRFmap is called. This leaves a window open. Is that intended?

A: Does all code need to stay compatible with Matlab 5.3?

A: What is the difference between Remote_Comm_isremote and Stim_Computer? 
   Are all combinations possible, or are they always identical?

Suggestions
=========== 
A: NEWSTIMCONFIGURATION: I would prefer to have it under version control, so that 
reinstalling the software on a computer will be easier, and no separate backups need to
be maintained. Could be done by using hostname and selecting filename based on host name.

A: Can I/you change 'screen' to 'Screen' when I encounter them. Matlab produces a warning about
inexact cases. I turned the warning off, but in future, it may produce errors.

A: Suggest moving ReceptiveFieldMapper to NewStim.
   Reason: reduce labspecific folders to the minimum, and some functions
    such as 'ReceptiveFieldGlobals' in ReceptiveFieldMapper are needed for 
    NewStim to run.
   Temporary solution: in startup.m added temporary addpath to 
          ~/Software/vhtools-dev/heimel/VH_matlab_code/NelsonLabTools/ReceptiveFieldMapper

A: INITSTIMS: In my version of initstims I do a kbcheck after the pause, so that CloseStimWindow
 can be called and the script can be ended gracefully. Can I port this?

A: INITSTIMS: I would find it convenient to have a debug mode which calls CloseStimScreen between scripts. This way
I can use initstims to show scripts on one computer by using two instances of Matlab. The debug mode could be set 
by a new StimWindowGlobal, e.g. the logical StimDebug. This makes ShowStimScreen open a 640x480 window. 
In DisplayStimulus it prevents the CLUT to be set to gray only at the end of the display.

A: NEWSTIMGLOBALS: You use pixels_per_cm as a global, but its name doesnot suggest that 
   it is a global variable. Perhaps use NewStimPixelsPerCm?
  
A: NEWSTIMGLOBALS: I like to have a global NewStimViewingDistance, which is set by NewStimConfiguration and tells the remote computer
at which distance his screen is compared to the subject. In all loadstim this parameter can be called instead of the stimulus 
parameter DISTANCE. For analysis it is necessary that NewStimViewingDistance is saved along with the stimuls script by the remote
client

A: NEWSTIMEDITOR and NEWSCRIPTEDITOR: It would be nice to let the program automatically suggest 
a name, e.g. ps20120416_1015

A: NEWSTIMEDITOR and NEWSCRIPTEDITOR: When accepting a name, check that no function exists with the 
same name, otherwise stimuluscomputer may produce an error


=====

A: STIMENDSOUND: I added the function StimEndSound, which is called by the script written by 'write_runscript_remote'. It should not affect any existing 
software. The function plays the train sound at the end of the stimulus display. It should work for Mac OS9 (but is OS language dependent! check) and 


A: I added a trigger parameter to the stimscript object, to make a conditional trigger for optogenetic control. 
this made changes in 
DisplayStimulus,DisplayStimScript, stimscript, stimscript/setDisplayMethod, ScriptObjEditor
and introduced stimscript/getTrigger



----------
Questions for Steve:
- is 'adjust_duration.m' still part of the code?
- is 'checkscript.m'  still part of the code?

- I have implemented NewStimList and NewStimScriptList as by getting all class files from the Stimuli and Script directories. Isn't that nicer?

- Should ReceptiveFieldMapper not go into NewStim?

- Should RFmap.m be in NewStimServices?

- why all the evals in NewStimInit instead of direct function calls?
